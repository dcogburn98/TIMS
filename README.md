# TIMS - Total Inventory Management System

## This was a pet project that I am no longer actively developing. It's been private for years and I'm making this repository public in case it helps anybody get a head start on creating their own POS system. In this journey, I've learned that it's very much in favor of a business to simply purchase a POS system rather than creating your own.
## I, as a business owner, was not able to balance the time spent working for the business and also develop this POS system with the bulletproof-design and rigorous testing that a POS software needs to be of any use to a business.
## If you decide to go this route as an entrepreneur in retail sales, I hope you have better success than I, and I will be more than willing to shed light on some of the awful code found in this repository. Many necessary features have yet to be implemented and I have no plans to continue development by myself.

TIMS (Total Inventory Management System) is a fully-featured business management software. TIMS' feature set includes the following:
 - Maintain and keep track of inventory
 - Perform Point-Of-Sale (POS) operations
 - Create invoices and keep track of customer balances
